# CaptureBlocksOfCode

This code will capture "blocks of code" (blocks with an specific color) from a webpage. I'll use it to capture the blocks of code of my blog into images, because Linkedin doesn't support this type of blocks

## Usage

Just install the components

    bower components
    
And open index.html in your browser.
